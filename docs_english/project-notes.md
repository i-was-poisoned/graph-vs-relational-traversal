# Project Notes: Graph vs. Relational Databases

## Topic

This project investigates a practical question: **at what traversal depth, and at
what data volume, does a property graph model outperform an equivalent normalized
relational model for the same query?**

Relational databases (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL) store data in tables and express
relationships through foreign keys. Querying a relationship means performing a
`JOIN`, and the database engine has to compute that join at query time — matching
rows across tables based on key equality. For a single relationship (e.g. "find a
user's orders"), this is fast and well-optimized by decades of relational query
planning. The problem shows up with **multi-hop relationship queries** — e.g. "find
friends-of-friends-of-friends who follow a person that liked a post I liked." Each
additional hop means another `JOIN`, and each `JOIN` multiplies the rows the engine
has to scan and match, so cost tends to grow rapidly with traversal depth.

Graph databases (e.g. Neo4j, ArangoDB) store relationships as first-class,
pre-materialized pointers between nodes ("index-free adjacency"). Traversing a
relationship means following a direct pointer rather than recomputing a join, so
query cost for a multi-hop traversal tends to scale with the size of the
*traversed subgraph*, not the size of the entire dataset. This is the theoretical
basis for the claim that graph databases "win" on deep, relationship-heavy queries,
while relational databases tend to win (or tie) on shallow queries, aggregations,
and workloads that are naturally tabular.

The open, project-specific question is *where the crossover point actually is* —
at what join depth and what data volume does the relational approach's cost start
exceeding the graph approach's cost, for a like-for-like schema and query. That
crossover point, rather than a general "graphs are better" claim, is what this
project aims to measure empirically.

## Resources in Use

- **Claude AI** — used as a research and writing assistant: exploring the
  literature and concepts around graph vs. relational performance, drafting and
  reviewing code, and helping structure documentation.
- **GitHub** — remote hosting for the project repository. Provides version
  history, backup, and (later) a place to collaborate or share the work.
- **VS Code** — the local code editor used for writing and running the project's
  code and managing the git repository day to day.
- **Overleaf** — used for writing up the project in LaTeX (e.g. a report or
  paper), separate from the code repository.
- **GH Archive** — the dataset source. Publishes hourly dumps of every public
  GitHub event as gzip-compressed JSON Lines files, with naturally
  graph-shaped relationships (actor → repo → event). The specific date/hour
  this project uses is recorded in the [README](../README.md) (kept there,
  not here, since it's reproducibility-critical project config rather than a
  learning note). See [gh-archive-guide.md](gh-archive-guide.md) for a full
  explanation of what GH Archive is and how it works.

For a thorough, from-first-principles explanation of what AI/Claude/an
"agent" actually are, what an IDE/VS Code/an "extension" are, what Python
is and how it compares to other languages, and JSON pretty-printing vs.
JSON Lines, see

## Why `.gitignore` and `README.md` Matter

### `README.md`: the project's front door

A `README.md` file is, at its core, just a plain-text document with
formatting — and the `.md` is the key to understanding what that actually
means. `.md` stands for **Markdown**: a lightweight markup language (not a
programming language) that lets you write formatted text — headings,
**bold**, *italics*, lists, links, code blocks — using nothing but plain
keyboard symbols (`#` for a heading, `**...**` for bold, `` `...` `` for
inline code) instead of needing a visual, Word-style editor. You write
plain text with those symbols scattered through it, and any program that
"understands" Markdown (GitHub, VS Code, this very document) renders it as
nicely formatted text. Every `.md` file in this project (this
`project-notes.md`, `README.md`, `gh-archive-guide.md`) is written in
Markdown for exactly that reason: it's readable even as raw, unrendered
text, and it renders cleanly anywhere that understands it.

`README` (capitalized, with no extension, or as `.md`/`.txt`) is also a
very old **convention** in software: by tradition, it's the first file
anyone new to a project is expected to read. GitHub (and GitLab,
Bitbucket, and virtually every other repository host) builds on that
convention automatically: if a repository has a file literally named
`README.md` (or `README`, `README.txt`, etc.) at its root, the platform
detects it and displays it already rendered, right below the file
listing, on the repository's main page. This isn't some special behavior
built into git itself — git gives no special treatment whatsoever to any
file named `README`; it's purely a behavior GitHub (and similar
platforms) layer on top of git, based on that conventional filename.
That's exactly why a well-written `README.md` is so valuable: it's
literally the first thing anyone (including your own future self, six
months from now with no fresh memory of the project) sees on visiting the
repository, so it should immediately answer "what is this, why does it
exist, and what question is it trying to answer?" — which is precisely
what this project's `README.md` does by leading with its research
question.

### `.gitignore`: what "tracking" even means in git, and why you have to tell it what to skip

Understanding `.gitignore` requires first understanding that git doesn't
automatically treat every file in your folder as "part of the project."
While you work in a repository, every file sits in one of these states:

- **Untracked** — git sees the file exists in the folder, but has never
  been told to watch it; it isn't part of the project's history, and
  `git status` flags it as "new."
- **Staged** — running `git add` tells git "I want this file, in its
  current state, to be part of the next commit."
- **Committed** — running `git commit` locks that staged state
  permanently into the repository's history.

Without a `.gitignore`, every new file that shows up in the folder —
including ones Python generates on its own, like `__pycache__/` caches,
or downloaded data in `data/` — would show up as "untracked" in `git
status`, and a careless `git add .` would sweep it into the next commit
without you noticing. `.gitignore` is, literally, a list of file/folder
name patterns that tells git "don't even show me these as 'untracked';
ignore them entirely." It uses wildcard-style patterns — for example, in
this project's own `.gitignore`:

- `/data/` — ignores the entire `data/` folder (the leading slash pins it
  to the project root, not any `data/` folder at any nesting level).
- `__pycache__/` — ignores any folder with that exact name, anywhere in
  the project (no leading slash, so it applies at every level).
- `*.py[codz]` — `*` is a wildcard meaning "any text here"; this ignores
  files like `something.pyc`, `something.pyo`, and so on.
- Lines starting with `#` are comments, for humans only — git skips them
  entirely when reading the file.

Why bother excluding these rather than just never running `git add` on
them by hand each time? Because without `.gitignore`, these
**regenerable** or **machine-specific** files (build caches, virtual
environments, credentials, OS- or editor-specific configuration) would
clutter commit history, bloat the repository's size with content that's
useless to anyone else, and — the more serious risk — could accidentally
leak your own machine's file paths or, worse, secrets like passwords or
API keys if one ever ends up in a file that gets committed by mistake.
`.gitignore` automates that discipline once, instead of relying on a
human never forgetting to make that mistake.

### Compilation: from source code to machine code

Understanding why so many lines in this project's `.gitignore` are about
"build artifacts" first requires understanding what **compiling** actually
is.

A computer's processor (the CPU) doesn't understand Python, or C, or any
other programming language the way a human writes it — it only
understands a very narrow, very specific set of binary instructions
(sequences of ones and zeros) called **machine code**, specific to each
processor architecture. The human-readable **source code** we write
(with meaningful variable names, comments, structure) exists purely so
humans can read and reason about it; the computer, as-is, can't run it
directly.

A **compiler** is a program whose sole job is translating source code,
written in a high-level language, into machine code (or some other
intermediate representation) before the program ever runs. That
translation process is called **compiling** (or "building"), and the
result — the already-translated file or files — is what's generally
called a **build artifact** (see the next section). In compiled languages
like C or Rust, this step happens explicitly, once, before the program
is ever run; the result is a standalone executable file.

Python, as covered in more depth in
[tools-and-concepts-guide.md](tools-and-concepts-guide.md#33-compiled-vs-interpreted-languages),
is an **interpreted** language — you don't manually compile this
project's scripts before running them; they run directly via `python
scripts/peek_data.py`. But behind the scenes, Python's own interpreter
still compiles each `.py` file into an intermediate form called
**bytecode** (simpler instructions than the original Python code, though
still not raw machine code) the first time it's imported or run, and
caches that bytecode in `.pyc` files inside a `__pycache__/` folder, so
it doesn't have to redo that translation work on every future run if the
source file hasn't changed. Those `.pyc` files are exactly a build
artifact — just one Python generates automatically, in the background,
rather than through a manual build step.

### What is a "build artifact"?

A **build artifact** (or just "artifact," or "build output") is any file
that's **generated** from source code by some automated process —
compiling, packaging, minifying, rendering — rather than being written by
hand by a person. The key distinction for this project:

- **Source code** (the `.py` files in `scripts/`, the `.md` files in
  `docs_*/`) is the **single source of truth** — what a person actually
  wrote, and the only thing that genuinely needs to live in the project's
  history.
- An **artifact** is *derived* from that source code — it can always be
  regenerated by running the same process against the same source code
  again, which makes committing it to git redundant at best, and actively
  harmful at worst.

Examples of build artifacts beyond Python's `.pyc` files already
mentioned (to make the concept fully general, not tied only to this
project): a `.exe` or `.dll` compiled from C/C++ source; a `.jar`
compiled from Java source; the final, minified, "bundled" HTML/CSS/
JavaScript a modern web app's build tool produces from its source code; a
`.whl` (wheel) file packaging a ready-to-install Python library; even
HTML documentation auto-generated from comments in source code.

Why build artifacts are almost never committed to a git repository (and
why this project's own `.gitignore` excludes so many of them —
`__pycache__/`, `*.py[codz]`, `build/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`, among
others):

1. **They're regenerable.** If the source code is in the repository,
   anyone can regenerate the exact same artifact at any time — storing it
   too would just be duplicating information for no benefit.
2. **They're often environment-specific.** A `.pyc` compiled against the
   Python version installed on this machine (Python 3.14, per the
   `__pycache__/` paths seen in this project) might not work the same
   way, or might not even load at all, on someone else's machine running
   a different Python version.
3. **They clutter history and diffs.** Artifacts are usually binary files
   (not line-by-line-readable text), so git can't show a useful
   line-by-line diff for them the way it can for source code — every
   change just shows up as "the whole file changed," with no information
   about what actually changed.
4. **They bloat repository size** with content that adds nothing to
   understanding the project — nobody needs to read a `.pyc` to
   understand what `peek_data.py` does; the `.py` file already tells
   them.

(One caveat worth knowing, for completeness: there are deliberate
exceptions to this general rule — for instance, when a project
*publishes* a finished artifact, like attaching a compiled executable to
a GitHub "Release" so people can download it directly without compiling
the source themselves. That's different from committing the artifact
into the repository's *commit history*, which is what `.gitignore` is
preventing here.)

## Repository Workflow So Far

1. Created the repository on GitHub first (remote).
2. Cloned it locally with `git clone` into `C:\dev\Research` — deliberately
   **outside** any OneDrive-synced folder (e.g. avoiding a path containing
   `OneDrive - Pedro`), since OneDrive syncing the same folder git is managing can
   cause file-locking conflicts, hit Windows' path length limits, and slow down
   both git and OneDrive. GitHub (remote) and OneDrive (local sync) are unrelated
   systems, but both would be fighting over the same local files if the repo
   lived inside a OneDrive folder.
3. At this stage, code is being written and committed locally; pushing to the
   GitHub remote is deferred until later.

## Testing Phase

First, let's go to the project root and start looking at the dataset for the
specific hour by running:

```bash
python scripts/download_gharchive.py
```

Important points before running this:

- **You must be inside the project root** (`C:\dev\Research`) when you run
  this command. It's run as `scripts/download_gharchive.py` (a relative path),
  so the shell needs to be sitting in the folder that contains the `scripts/`
  directory — otherwise it won't find the file.
- **Python needs to be on your PATH.** This means your system knows where the
  `python` program lives so it can be run by name from any terminal, instead
  of needing the full install path typed out every time. If running `python
  scripts/download_gharchive.py` gives a "command not found" style error, try
  `python3` instead — some installs only register that name. (This is
  different from the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable, which is about where
  Python looks for importable modules, not about finding the `python`
  executable itself — not something this script needs.)
- The script creates a `data/` folder automatically on first run — no need to
  create it yourself. It's excluded from git via `.gitignore` since it's raw,
  regenerable data, not project code.
- A successful run prints progress for the download and decompression, ending
  with a line like `Done: data/2026-08-27-15.json` — that file is the
  decompressed dataset, ready to be read line by line (see
  [gh-archive-guide.md](gh-archive-guide.md), section 8).

Note: the first run hit an `HTTP Error 403: Forbidden` from GH Archive's
server, caused by `urllib`'s default `User-Agent` header looking like a
script rather than a browser. Fixed by building the request manually with a
browser-like `User-Agent` header instead of using `urlretrieve` directly (see
the script for the fix and [download_gharchive.py](download_gharchive.py),
the annotated copy, for the full explanation).

## Version Control Workflow (git add → commit → push)

With the download/peek scripts and docs in place, the next routine step was
committing and pushing this work to GitHub. The commands used, in order:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Exploration stage set up"
git push
```

This first push failed with an HTTP 403, because Windows' cached GitHub
login belonged to a different account (a work account) than the one that
owns this repo. Fixed by repointing the remote at the correct account
without touching the cached work credential:

```bash
git remote -v
git remote set-url origin https://i-was-poisoned@github.com/i-was-poisoned/graph-vs-relational-traversal.git
git push -u origin main
```

See [git-commands-guide.md](git-commands-guide.md) for a full explanation of
what each of these commands actually does, the staging-area concept behind
`add`/`commit`, and why the account mix-up happened.

## Exploration Stage (download_gharchive.py --> peek_data.py)

Now that we have a dataset downloaded and decompressed into JSON Lines format
(`data/2026-08-27-15.json`), the next step is to actually look at what's in
it, before trying to model it relationally or as a graph.

`scripts/peek_data.py` reads the first few events from the file and prints
their key fields (`type`, `actor`, `repo`, `created_at`) — a quick sanity
check that the data looks like what [gh-archive-guide.md](gh-archive-guide.md)
described, before writing any real parsing/loading logic against it.

Run it with:

```bash
python scripts/peek_data.py
```

This prints the first 5 events by default. Useful variations:

```bash
# Print more events
python scripts/peek_data.py --lines 20

# Point at a different downloaded file
python scripts/peek_data.py --file data/2026-08-27-15.json --lines 10
```

## Summary Stage (summarize_data.py)

With the shape of a single event confirmed by `peek_data.py`, the next step
is to get a sense of *volume and connectivity* across the whole downloaded
hour, before picking a schema: how many events, how they break down by
type, and how many distinct actors/repos are involved.

`scripts/summarize_data.py` reads the full JSON Lines file once and reports:

- total event count
- event type breakdown (count and percentage, most common first)
- unique actor and unique repo counts
- the top N most active actors and repos by event count

Run it with:

```bash
python scripts/summarize_data.py

# Show more top actors/repos
python scripts/summarize_data.py --top 10
```

For the fixed 2026-08-27 15:00 UTC hour, this showed 69,429 events across
14,728 unique actors and 16,497 unique repos, with `PushEvent` alone
accounting for 95.3% of all events. The most active actors are all bots
(`github-actions[bot]`, `dependabot[bot]`, `pull[bot]`, `renovate[bot]`,
`cursor[bot]`) — worth deciding on a bot-filtering policy before this data
is used to build the relational/graph models, since bot-driven `PushEvent`s
would otherwise dominate the connectivity being measured.

## What "benchmark" means, for this project

Before going further, it's worth being precise about a word this project
uses constantly. A **benchmark** is a fair, repeatable, *timed* test used to
compare two or more things under the same conditions — not just "run it
once and see," but deliberately controlling everything except the one
thing being measured, so the result is a genuine comparison rather than a
fluke caused by, say, the laptop doing something else in the background
during one of the two runs.

For this project specifically: a benchmark run means taking the *same*
multi-hop query (e.g. "starting from actor X, find all repos reachable
within 3 hops") and running it against the relational database and the
graph database, on the *same* underlying data, timing how long each takes.
That gets repeated across different hop-depths and data volumes to find
the crossover point the README asks about.

## Schema Design Principle: Query-First, Not Field-First

A tempting shortcut would be to look at every field GH Archive provides and
build a table or node type for each one. That's the wrong order. Schema
design for a benchmark should be driven by the *query* being tested, not by
"whatever fields happen to exist":

- **Field-first** means scanning the data, seeing fields like commit
  messages, PR review text, and issue labels, and modeling all of it. This
  produces a big, detailed schema — most of which the traversal benchmark
  never actually touches.
- **Query-first** means deciding *first* exactly what's being measured
  (for this project: an `actor → repo → actor → repo` walk — see below for
  why it has to be this shape, not a direct actor-to-actor one), and then
  building only the minimal structure that walk needs: an Actor thing, a
  Repo thing, and a connection between them.

Why this matters beyond tidiness: extra, unused tables/columns (or
node/edge types) don't make either side of the comparison "more correct" —
they just add complexity that isn't part of the measurement. Worse, if
that extra detail is built unevenly (more on the relational side than the
graph side, or vice versa), the comparison stops being like-for-like,
which is the entire point of this project's research question.

## Schema Design Stage (profile_schema.py)

The data is inherently **bipartite**: every event connects one `actor` to
one `repo` (see [gh-archive-guide.md](gh-archive-guide.md#actors-repos-and-events)
for the full actor/repo/event distinction). That means a "multi-hop
traversal" here can't be the classic friends-of-friends example from this
project's opening research question — there's no direct actor-to-actor
edge in the raw data by default. A traversal has to alternate
`actor → repo → actor → repo`, hopping through *shared repos* (or, where
available, through a second actor named inside an event's `payload`).

To design that schema well — following the query-first principle above —
the next step was finding out *where in the data a second actor actually
appears*, since without one, there's nothing to hop to beyond "another repo
this same actor touched." `scripts/profile_schema.py` reads the full file
and reports, per event type:

- which `payload` fields exist, how often, and what type they hold
- any nested object shaped like a GitHub user reference (`{"id": ...,
  "login": "..."}`) found anywhere inside `payload`, and the path to it
  (e.g. `payload.pull_request.user`)

Run it with:

```bash
python scripts/profile_schema.py

# Focus on one event type
python scripts/profile_schema.py --type PushEvent
```

**Key finding:** `PushEvent` — 95.3% of all events in this project's fixed
hour — carries no second actor anywhere in its payload; it only has `ref`,
`before`/`head` (commit SHAs), and `repository_id`. `PullRequestEvent`'s
`payload.pull_request` is also a trimmed reference object that omits the
PR's author (unlike GitHub's full REST API response). Real second-actor
references live almost entirely in the remaining ~4.7% of events —
comments, reviews, issues, releases, forks, and membership changes (full
breakdown in
[gh-archive-guide.md](gh-archive-guide.md#where-a-second-actor-appears-nested-references)).
This directly shapes the schema decision: an actor-to-actor edge type, if
modeled at all, will be sparse and drawn from a small slice of event types —
most of the graph's connectivity will come from the actor→repo edges
themselves (many actors sharing a repo), not from direct actor→actor links.

The overall pipeline so far is: **download_gharchive.py → peek_data.py →
summarize_data.py → profile_schema.py** — first fetch and decompress the
fixed dataset hour, then inspect a handful of raw events, then get an
aggregate read on volume and connectivity, then profile the payload shape
and locate second-actor references, before moving on to actually
extracting and loading records into the relational and graph models being
compared.
